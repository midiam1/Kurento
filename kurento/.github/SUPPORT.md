# How to solve problems

If you are facing an issue with Kurento Media Server, follow this basic checklist:

* **Step 1**: Test with the **latest version** of Kurento Media Server. We do **not** provide support for older versions. Follow the installation instructions here: [Installation Guide](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation.html). You can also try with a nightly build, to see if the issue has been fixed in the latest (unreleased) development branch: [Installing Nightly Builds](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation_dev.html).

* **Step 2**: Read the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/troubleshooting.html) and our FAQ about [STUN and TURN](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/faq.html#about-nat-ice-stun-turn). We try to document there the most commonly encountered problems.

* **Step 3**: Search for your problem in our [GitHub bugtracker](https://github.com/Kurento/bugtracker/issues), and the [Kurento Public Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kurento).

* Kurento does **not** provide free personal support. We do offer professional consulting, which you can request by writing an email to openvidu[AT]gmail.com.
