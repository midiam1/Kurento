> :warning: **Warning**
>
> Bower dependencies are not yet upgraded for Kurento 7.0.0.
>
> Kurento tutorials that use pure browser JavaScript need to be rewritten to drop the deprecated Bower service and instead use a web resource packer. This has not been done, so these tutorials won't be able to download the dependencies they need to work. PRs would be appreciated!
