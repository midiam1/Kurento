# Do not align continuations with previous lines.
# Reason: Wastes horizontal space for no reason.
AlignAfterOpenBracket: DontAlign

# Do not align the backslashes in multi-line macros.
# Reason: Position of backslashes should be internally consistent only with their own line.
AlignEscapedNewlines: DontAlign

# Do not align consecutive trailing comments.
# Reason: Position of comments should be internally consistent only with their own line.
AlignTrailingComments: false

# Pack arguments so that they use the least amount of space.
# Reason: Follows Gnome, although going against other tools like Prettier or Rustfmt.
AllowAllArgumentsOnNextLine: false
AllowAllParametersOfDeclarationOnNextLine: false
BinPackArguments: true
BinPackParameters: false

# Do not align continuations with previous lines.
# Reason: Wastes horizontal space for no reason.
AlignOperands: DontAlign

# Put operators at the beginning of the line, not at the end.
# Reason: Maths and Python are wiser than LLVM.

BreakBeforeBinaryOperators: NonAssignment

# Where should braces go?
# * Attach: Always attach braces to surrounding context.
# * Linux: Like Attach, but break before braces on function, namespace and class definitions.
BreakBeforeBraces: Linux

# Where should function return types go?
AlwaysBreakAfterReturnType: AllDefinitions

# Do not break user-visible strings.
# Reason: It breaks "grep" and other code search tools.
# https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings
BreakStringLiterals: false

# Do not break comments.
# Reason: Leave the developer choose the length and format of comments.
ReflowComments: false

# Do not sort includes. Who the hell thought this could be a good default?
# Reason: It can break the code itself, making builds fail.
SortIncludes: false

SpaceBeforeParens: Always
